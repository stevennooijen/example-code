    "\n",
    "There are quite a few different methods to predict future trends, for example, ARIMA, ARCH, regressive models, neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a good [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse_open/blob/master/jupyter_english/topic09_time_series/topic9_part1_time_series_python.ipynb) on time series forecasting demonstrating some of these.\n",

    "### Linear model with kernel trick\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- can use simple feature engineering trick with radial basis functions\n",
    "- this scales on any backend since we're simply using linear regression\n",
    "- we can interpret all variables\n",
    "- we can specifically argue that we only filter out the long term season, the residuals can be analyzed further with other models\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- the model is a bit biased\n",
    "- the model wouldn't work if the seasonality changes over time"
